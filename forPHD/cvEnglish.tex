%\section{Person Statement}
I have two dreams, becoming a Computer Vision researcher and educated in the
United States (American dream).  Pursuing a dream is not going well. I meet the
academic challenge in the third semester for my bachelor degree
in computer science. I have failed a couple of subjects. My chosen subjects
strategy is wrong, I have chosen too much core subjects at once. But, as you can
be seen, my last year, average scores got distinction but average scores not
good in total. On master study, I have stopped in the middle because if I
finished that, I will no change pay tuition fee and study in the USA. In China
University of Ming and Technology, I have a good academic record, but the
English language is not good, so I have not successful go to the USA directly.

\section{Academy Congress and Conference}
On August 11, 2017, I took part in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Sections Congress (SC2017), in Sydney, showing my final year project about Human Resource Management System based on Web.

\section{Extracurricular Activity}
I am a big fan of amateur radio (ham radio).
This is my biggest extracurricular activity.
In 2014, I have got my first amateur radio license (foundation license).
At that time, my purpose is talking and learning English because I can talk or send a message with all over the world radio amateur.
After my purpose is changed. I have found amateur radio have bigger relate with my major, computer science.
Amateur radio is not only sent morse code, which becomes history.
I am currently got my standard license.
So, I am more and more using new technology for radio.
Such as SSTV for the picture, D-STAR for digital mode voice transfer and data transfer.
Even International Space Station(ISS) also have got amateur radio FM repeater.
I am more and more focus on technique part for radio.
I also take part in some amateur radio competition.
For example, ross a. Hull memorial vhf-uhf contest.
I have got Twelfth Place in Section A (Analog Modes, Best 7 Days) and Twelfth Place in Section C (Analog Modes, Best 2 Days)).
This is only a part of my amateur radio activity.
