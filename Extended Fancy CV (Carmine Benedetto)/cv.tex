\section{Academy Congress and Conference}
On August 11, 2017, I took part in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Sections Congress (SC2017), in Sydney, showing my final year project about Human Resource Management System based on Web.

\section{Extracurricular Activity}
I am a big fan of amateur radio (ham radio).
This is my biggest extracurricular activity.
In 2014, I have got my first amateur radio license (foundation license).
At that time, my purpose is talking and learning English because I can talk or send a message with all over the world radio amateur.
After my purpose is changed. I have found amateur radio have bigger relate with my major, computer science.
Amateur radio is not only sent morse code, which becomes history.
I am currently got my standard license.
So, I am more and more using new technology for radio.
Such as SSTV for the picture, D-STAR for digital mode voice transfer and data transfer.
Even International Space Station(ISS) also have got amateur radio FM repeater.
I am more and more focus on technique part for radio.
I also take part in some amateur radio competition.
For example, ross a. Hull memorial vhf-uhf contest.
I have got Twelfth Place in Section A (Analog Modes, Best 7 Days) and Twelfth Place in Section C (Analog Modes, Best 2 Days)).
This is only a part of my amateur radio activity.

\section{Research \& Project}
\subsection*{Software Engineering Aspect}
In 2017, using metamorphic testing method for automatic evaluation of machine translation software.
In 2015, using UML construct a use case diagram, class diagram, interaction diagram, context diagram and data flow diagram for a game shop.

\subsection{Multimedia Aspect}
• In 2017, using OPENGL construct a room with four walls and a floor, as well as two paintings, which are hung on separate walls, light, table and desk and so on.
• In 2016, using SDL develop a program to process signal using the 5 th order low-pass Butterworth filter and to play the processed signal.
• In 2016, using SDL develop a colour image display and enhancement program. The program enhances an image using histogram equalization and displays the enhanced image.

\subsection{Algorithms Aspect}
• In 2017, doing some research about count unique word appear frequency and sort word
• frequency by decreasing count order. My main I am data structure is using tries to record each unique word.
In 2017, This project is about simulate shop service drive by event not by time.
Security Aspect
• Implementing a rainbow table using c++.

\subsection{Hardware Aspect}
• In. 2017, Swap card system for record attendance. I have using Arduino, raspberry
• pi, the level shifter, LCD controller and LCD screen. In raspberry pi, I have written by Python, using HTTP socket connect with Java backend. And using I2C bus connect with Raspberry Pi, Arduino and LCD controller. Level shifter for convert different volt in the I2C bus. RFID sense connects with Arduino. In Arduino, I have written by c++.
Using NodeMCU with Google Home control light at home (working).
Database Aspect
• In 2017, using MYSQL doing human resource management system for final year project. • In 2017, using RDF semantics database for record movie data
Web Aspect
• In 2016, making my own blog using Jekyll.
• In 2014, creating Illawarra film Society website based on Drupal.
